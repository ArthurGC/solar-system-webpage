            <h1>Mercury</h1>
            <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun
                takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content_dsc">
            <h1>Venus</h1>
            <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. As the
                brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be, on rare
                occasions, visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content_dsc">
            <h1>Earth</h1>
            <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. About 29.2%
                of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 70.8% is covered with
                water, mostly by oceans, seas, gulfs, and other salt-water bodies, but also by lakes, rivers, and other
                fresh water, which together constitute the hydrosphere.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content_dsc">
            <h1>Mars</h1>
            <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger
                than only Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as
                the "Red Planet".</p>

        <div class="content_dsc">
            <h1>Jupiter</h1>
            <p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a
                mass (more than) two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, but (a
                little) less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content_dsc">
            <h1>Saturn</h1>
            <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is
                a gas giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth. It only has
                one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more
                massive.</p>

        <div class="content_dsc">
            <h1>Uranus</h1>
            <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to the Greek god of the sky, Uranus,
                who, according to Greek mythology, was the grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter) and father of Cronus (Saturn).
                It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content_dsc">
            <h1>Neptune</h1>
            <p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar planet from the Sun. In the Solar System, it is the
                fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17
                times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus.</p>
